<h2>All about CBD</h2>

<h3>What is CBD?</h3>
CBD, short for cannabidiol, is a chemical compound (cannabinoid), found in the cannabis plant.

There are 113 identified cannabinoids in cannabis, with CBD being the most abundant non-psychoactive compound. Of all the different cannabinoids in the cannabis plant, THC and CBD are the most popular.

The difference between CBD and THC is that CBD does not have any psychoactive properties and will not get you high.

<h3>Which conditions can CBD help with?</h3>
CBD has the potential to treat a wide range of conditions including anxiety, insomnia, pain and other ailments.

We recommend our consumers research the vast amount of information available online about the specifics of how CBD interacts with the brain and body.

Due to federal regulations, we are not able to discuss any specific health benefits or make any medical
claims that CBD may or may not provide.

<h3>What is bioavailability?</h3>
The bioavailability of CBD is the percentage of CBD that is absorbed into the bloodstream after being processed through the body. This percentage depends on the potency CBD that enters your system. Whether it is orally, sublingually, or through inhalation. When you take CBD
sublingually, the substance enters your bloodstream at a higher percentage for quick relief.

Our products are created with a high concentration of bioavailability, ensuring efficient delivery throughout the body.

<h2>All about the Endocannabinoid System</h2>

<h3>What is the endocannabinoid system?</h3>
The Endocannabinoid System (ECS) maintains homeostasis in our bodies.
Homeostasis allows for the overall conditions in our bodies to stay at the ideal level, creating internal stability.

Three parts make up the ECS: cannabinoid receptors, endocannabinoids, and metabolic enzymes. These receptors operate together to regulate many of the body’s vital functions. Cannabis-based therapies interact with the ECS to boost efficiency and supplement the body’s processes.

<h3>What are cannabinoids?</h3>
Humans, animals, and cannabis have cannabinoid receptors and an endocannabinoid system. Cannabinoids are receptors that work in the Endocannabinoid system to regulate homeostasis in our bodies. These receptors are supplemented when a person consumes cannabis products.

There are estimated approximately 113 cannabinoids in the cannabis plant, the most notable including THC and CBD, which give the plant medicinal and recreational properties.

CBD is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid that provides anti-inflammatory and medicinal properties. THC is known for its psychoactive properties that give a recreational high. Other cannabinoids include cannabigerol, cannabinol, and cannabichromene.

<h2>Micro Dosing</h2>

Freshly Foraged believes in giving our consumers the knowledge to sculpt their cannabis experience with precision and accuracy. Micro dosing is the practice of ingesting small measured amounts of cannabis to receive health benefits without the psychoactive side effects.

Small doses of cannabis can help create a feeling of balance within your daily life, making it possible to work, focus, and relax without any interference with your energy levels. These measured doses support your endocannabinoid system, elevating your body’s ability to regulate processes.

Freshly Foraged recommends starting at a dose of around five to ten milligrams a day, increasing slowly to find your sweet spot for optimal performance. With education, you gain the power to personalize your experience, making cannabis part of our daily routine.



<h2>What is Plant Synergy?</h2>

Plants have an innate intelligence to offer us healing. When used in thoughtful combinations and recipes, plants can work together to support each other, boosting their beneficial properties.

Plant synergy is the interaction and teamwork of different medicinal plants that enhance one another.
